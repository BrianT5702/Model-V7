- [ ] Build script (`build.sh`) created
- [ ] Static files collection configured
- [ ] Template directory created for Django

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Railway Deployment (Recommended for Testing)
- [ ] Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Set environment variables
- [ ] Configure build and start commands
- [ ] Deploy and test

### 2. Render Deployment (Alternative)
- [ ] Sign up at [render.com](https://render.com)
- [ ] Create web service
- [ ] Connect repository
- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Configure build and start commands
- [ ] Deploy and test

## Post-Deployment Testing

### âœ… Backend Health Check
- [ ] API endpoints accessible
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] Admin panel accessible
- [ ] CORS working properly

### âœ… Frontend Functionality
- [ ] React app loads correctly
- [ ] 2D canvas working
- [ ] 3D visualization working
- [ ] Material calculator functional
- [ ] Export features working

### âœ… User Experience
- [ ] Navigation working
- [ ] Forms submitting correctly
- [ ] Data persistence working
- [ ] Error handling working

## Environment Variables to Set

```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
DEBUG=False
ALLOWED_HOSTS=your-app-name.railway.app
DB_NAME=your-db-name
DB_USER=your-db-user
DB_PASSWORD=your-db-password
DB_HOST=your-db-host
DB_PORT=5432
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app-name.railway.app
```

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Test build locally
./deploy.sh

# Check if everything is ready
python manage.py check --deploy

# Test static files
python manage.py collectstatic --dry-run

# Test production settings
python manage.py runserver --settings=model_builder.settings_production
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Build fails**: Check Python/Node.js versions
- **Database issues**: Verify environment variables
- **Static files**: Run `collectstatic` locally first
- **CORS errors**: Check `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` format

## Success Indicators

âœ… Your app is accessible via a public URL  
âœ… Testers can access the system with a single click  
âœ… All features work as expected  
âœ… Database operations are working  
âœ… Export functionality is operational
